#Code Book

**subject** - Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from **1 to 30**. 

**ACTIVITY** - The activity performed by a subject. The list of values is:
	
- WALKING
	
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	
- SITTING
	
- STANDING
	
- LAYING

> Note: The combination between subject and ACTIVITY is unique in the tidy data set.

For the features presented below, it was applied an **average** function calculated by the combination of **subject and ACTIVITY**.

This means that for each combination of **subject and ACTIVITY**, it was performed an average of all the window samples observed.

In result, and since it was stated in the original **README.txt** (on the data set coming from the zip file) that 

> features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1] 

these boundaries remained intact i.e. **[-1,1]**
